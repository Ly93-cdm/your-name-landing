## 📖 About the Movies
**Your Name** is a Japanese animated film released in 2016, written and directed by **Makoto Shinkai**.  
The story follows two teenagers who mysteriously swap bodies, creating a deep connection while trying to understand this supernatural phenomenon.  

In addition, the project also features references to **Weathering With You (2019)**, another work by Makoto Shinkai, which tells the story of a boy who runs away to Tokyo and meets a girl with the mysterious ability to control the weather.  

## 💡 Inspiration
This project was created as a visual tribute to the poetic and emotional narratives of Makoto Shinkai’s works, mainly *Your Name* and *Weathering With You*.  
The interface explores themes of memory, time, human connection, and the power of nature, blending visual storytelling with interactive design.
